# A simple weather app

I built a simple weather app to get a deeper understanding of front-end development and APIs.

This project uses Openweathermap API.

I could have made it look prettier, added animations or more functionality. But you can't learn multiple things at once.

Feature added: Separate frontend and backend

# Running it

- Run `docker compose up -d` and go to `localhost:8080` in a web browser.
- You can also run the standalone version without separate backend. Open up the `standalone/index.html` in your web browser.
