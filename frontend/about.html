		<p>
			I built a simple weather app to get a deeper understanding of
			front-end development and APIs.<br>
				This project uses Openweathermap API.<br><br>
				I could have made it look prettier, added animations or more functionality. But you can&#39;t learn multiple things at once.<br><br>
			It has two backends: node and go.<br>
				I couldn't decide on a language for backend, so I tried out both NodeJS and Golang.<br><br>
				This app is deployed on Heroku <a href="https://weather-webapp-basic.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is free until November 28th, 2022. Uptime after that is uncertain.<br>
				The source code for this project is hosted on Github <a href="https://github.com/sujay1844/weather-webapp">here</a>

		<p>
			I would describe myself as an aspiring software developer. I did this project after my 12th exams and before joining my Undergraduate. Around Sep 2022. Check out my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/sujay1844" target="_blank">here</a>.
