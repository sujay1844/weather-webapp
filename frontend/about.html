		<p>
			I built a simple weather app to get a deeper understanding of
			front-end development and APIs.<br>
				This project uses Openweathermap API.<br><br>
				I could have made it look prettier, added animations or more functionality. But you can&#39;t learn multiple things at once.<br><br>
			It has two backends: node and go.<br>
				I couldn't decide on a language for backend, so I tried out both NodeJS and Golang.<br><br>
			This app is deployed on <a href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. It is free until November 28th, 2022. Uptime after that is uncertain.
